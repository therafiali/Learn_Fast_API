Here’s a breakdown of the code:

from typing import Annotated: This line is importing the Annotated class from the typing module. However, it’s not used in the provided code.

from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI, HTTPException, status: This line is importing several classes and functions from the fastapi module. Depends is a function used for declaring dependencies in FastAPI. FastAPI is the class used to create the main application. HTTPException is a class used to raise HTTP exceptions. status is a module containing HTTP status code constants.

from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer, OAuth2PasswordRequestForm: This line is importing two classes from the fastapi.security module. OAuth2PasswordBearer is a class used to declare an OAuth2 password bearer type dependency. OAuth2PasswordRequestForm is a class used to declare a form body with the parameters required for OAuth2 password flow.

from models import User, UserInDB: This line is importing two classes from a module named models. These classes likely represent user data models.

app = FastAPI(): This line is creating an instance of the FastAPI class, which represents the main application.

oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(tokenUrl="token"): This line is creating an instance of the OAuth2PasswordBearer class, which represents an OAuth2 password bearer type dependency. The tokenUrl parameter is the URL that the client (user’s browser) will use to send the token to the server.

@app.post("/login"): This line is declaring a route for HTTP POST requests to the /login URL.

async def login(form_data: OAuth2PasswordRequestForm = Depends()):: This line is defining an asynchronous function named login. The function has a single parameter, form_data, which is an instance of the OAuth2PasswordRequestForm class. The Depends() function is used to declare that this parameter is a dependency that should be resolved by FastAPI.

return {"access_token": form_data.username, "token_type": "bearer"}: This line is returning a JSON response with an access token and token type. In this case, the access token is just the username from the form data, and the token type is "bearer".

@app.post("/generate_token"): This line is declaring a route for HTTP POST requests to the /generate_token URL.

async def generate_token(form_data: OAuth2PasswordRequestForm = Depends()):: This line is defining an asynchronous function named generate_token, which is similar to the login function.

@app.get("/users/me"): This line is declaring a route for HTTP GET requests to the /users/me URL.

async def read_users_me(token:str = Depends(oauth2_scheme)):: This line is defining an asynchronous function named read_users_me. The function has a single parameter, token, which is a string. The Depends(oauth2_scheme) function is used to declare that this parameter is a dependency that should be resolved by FastAPI using the oauth2_scheme instance.

return {"user":"Rafi Ali", "age":22}: This line is returning a JSON response with user data. In this case, the user data is hard-coded.
