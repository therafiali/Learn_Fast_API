# Introduction to SQLModel

SQLModel is a library for interacting with SQL databases from Python code, with Python objects. It is designed to be intuitive, easy to use, highly compatible, and robust.

You have all the power of SQLAlchemy and Pydantic underneath.
It minimize code duplication. A single type annotation does a lot of work. **No need to duplicate models in SQLAlchemy and Pydantic.**
