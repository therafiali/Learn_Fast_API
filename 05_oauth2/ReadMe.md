data.py: This file contains a dictionary of users for the purpose of this example. Each user has a username, full name, email, hashed password, and a disabled status.

models.py: This file defines two Pydantic models, User and UserInDB. User is a base model with fields: username, email, full_name, and disabled. UserInDB inherits from User and adds a hashed_password field.

main.py: This is where the FastAPI application is defined and routes are set up.

fake_hash_password(password: str): This function is a placeholder for password hashing. In a real application, you’d use a secure method to hash the password.

oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(tokenUrl="token"): This sets up the OAuth2 password bearer with the URL where the client will send the username and password.

get_current_user(token: str): This function takes in a token and decodes it to get the current user. If the user is not found, it raises an HTTPException with status 401.

get_current_active_user(current_user: User): This function checks if the current user is active. If not, it raises an HTTPException with status 400.

login(form_data: OAuth2PasswordRequestForm): This is the route where users send their username and password to get a token. It checks if the username and password match a user in the database, and if they do, it returns an access token.

read_users_me(current_user: User): This route returns the current user’s information.

Please note that this is a simplified example and doesn’t include some important aspects of a real-world application, such as secure password hashing and handling of refresh tokens. Also, the fake_decode_token and find_user_dict functions are not defined in the provided code. They should be implemented to decode the user token and find a user in your database, respectively.

service.py

get_user(db, username: str): This function takes a database and a username as arguments. It checks if the username exists in the database. If it does, it retrieves the user’s data, creates a UserInDB object with that data (using the ** operator to unpack the dictionary into keyword arguments), and returns that object.

fake_decode_token(token): This function takes a token as an argument, which it uses as a username to retrieve a user from the fake_users_db using the get_user function. It then returns this user. The comment suggests that this is a placeholder function that doesn’t provide any real security.

find_user_dict(username: str): This function takes a username as an argument and returns the corresponding user data from fake_users_db using the get method of the dictionary, which returns None if the username does not exist in the database.
